# Vending Machine (DFA Visualizer)

This project is a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) visualizer tailored specifically for modeling the functionality of a vending machine. DFA is a mathematical model used to represent finite states and transitions between those states in a system.

In this context, the vending machine is represented as a DFA, where each state represents a different stage in the vending process (e.g., idle, selecting item, dispensing, etc.), and transitions between states are triggered by user input (e.g., inserting coins, selecting an item).

The purpose of this visualizer is to provide a clear and intuitive representation of how a vending machine operates, allowing users to understand its functionality through visualizations of states and transitions.
